# Overview
This project is a demonstration in predictive modeling for employee attrition using machine learning. The dataset used for this project is a fictitious dataset originally found on Kaggle but the source is no longer available. 

This notebook will walkthrough the end-to-end process of exploring a dataset, preprocessing features, building models, and evaluating models. The libraries used in this project are Pandas, Numpy, Plotly, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, and Scikitplot. 

Note: Github will only show static notebook renders so you will not be able to see the Plotly graphs due to the embedded JavaScript and HTML within. For full render viewing there are two options:

* [View the full render notebook here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/changchunhui/employee_attrition_modeling/blob/main/Employee_Attrition_Modeling.ipynb)
* If the link above does not work please download the HTML file from this repo, or clone the full repo if you wish to run the notebook locally
